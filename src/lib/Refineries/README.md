# Refineries and RefineryComplexes

## Overview

Theseus introduces Refineries and RefineryComplexes as foundational tools for state management. Refineries
facilitate data transformations through both singular mutations and sequential, chained transformations.
RefineryComplexes enable grouping of these Refineries for more complex and organized state evolution
scenarios.

## Refineries

Refineries are designed to encapsulate specific transformations on data, offering a modular approach to state
management.

### Forges

Methods within a Refinery that are tasked with deriving new states or outcomes based on the current state are
known as **Forges**.

-   **Immutable data**: Each Forge receives a first argument that is a data object with a single key.

    This key is named `immutable` concatenated with the value of `noun` provided in the `Refinery.create`
    method.

    If no `noun` is provided, the default key is `input`. Thus, if a `noun` of "state" is provided, the data
    will be called `immutableState`.

    Any attempt to mutate this object within a Forge will result in an error, as the object is deeply frozen
    before any Forge runs.

    As such, Refineries differ from Evolvers in that they should be used to create new data from the original
    data, rather than modifying the input.

-   **TypeScript Inference**: For TypeScript inference to work when Forges reference their own Refinery, the
    Refinery must explicitly declare its return types. Circular references without explicit return type
    declarations can break inference.
-   **Usage in RefineryComplexes**: Similar to Evolvers in `EvolverComplexes`, the names of Refineries are
    used directly within `RefineryComplexes` but with the term "Refinery" removed from either the beginning or
    the end for brevity.

    For example, if a RefineryComplex includes `OddNumberRefinery`, it will be accessible at
    `MyRefineryComplex.refine(myData).OddNumber`.

### Example: Dungeons & Dragons Character Status Refinery

This refinery processes aspects of a character's status, such as health and effects, to generate a descriptive
status report.

```typescript
import { getTheseusLogger, Refinery } from "theseus-js";
import { CharacterState } from "./state/CharacterState";
import type { StatusReport } from "./types/StatusReport";

const log = getTheseusLogger("CharacterStatusRefinery");

export const { CharacterStatusRefinery } = Refinery.create("CharacterStatusRefinery", {
    noun: "CharacterState",
})
    .toRefine<CharacterState>()
    .withForges({
        calculateHealth: ({ immutableCharacterState }) => {
            const healthModifiers = immutableCharacterState.modifiers.filter((m) => m.type === "HEALTH");
            const totalMultiplier = healthModifiers.reduce((acc, { multiplier }) => (acc *= multiplier), 1);
            return immutableCharacterState.health * totalMultiplier;
        },
        listActiveEffects: ({ immutableCharacterState }) => {
            return immutableCharacterState.activeEffects.join(", ");
        },
        // Make the return type explicit to avoid TypeScript inference circular references
        generateStatusReport: ({ immutableCharacterState }): StatusReport => {
            const health = CharacterStatusRefinery.refine(immutableCharacterState).using.calculateHealth();
            const effects = immutableCharacterState.activeEffects.join(", ");
            return {
                health,
                effects,
            };
        },
    });
```

## RefineryComplexes

RefineryComplexes organize multiple related Refineries, facilitating complex state evolution in a structured
manner.

### Example: Dungeons & Dragons Game Session RefineryComplex

This complex groups refineries that manage different aspects of a game session, such as character status and
inventory management.

```typescript
import { RefineryComplex } from "theseus-js";
import { GameState } from "../../state/GameState";

export const GameSessionRefineryComplex = RefineryComplex.create<GameState>().withRefineries({
    CharacterStatusRefinery,
    InventoryRefinery,
});
```

### Using the Refineries and RefineryComplexes

After defining the refineries, hereâ€™s how you might use them to refine character and game states in a Dungeons
& Dragons context.

```typescript
// Using CharacterStatusRefinery to refine character state
let characterState: CharacterState = {
    health: 100,
    activeEffects: ["Poisoned", "Blessed"],
    // Other character state attributes...
};

const statusReport = CharacterStatusRefinery.refine(characterState).using.generateStatusReport();

const {
	CharacterStatus,
	Inventory
} = GameSessionRefineryComplex.refine(gameState).

const statusReport = CharacterStatus.generateStatusReport();
const inventory = Inventory.get();

```
